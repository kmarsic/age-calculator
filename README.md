## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

This project helped me understand ternary operators in JS and also how sometimes they might not be the best option.  



### Continued development

I really liked this project and I plan to do more projects like this one, with the goal of improving my skills and becoming more confident in my code.


### Useful resources

- [Hyperplexed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5oawMJaXbU) - I used this code as a basis for my animation, altough altering it just a bit to fit my purposes, converting it from a event listener to a function.
